🏔️ Mount Everest Expedition Analysis – Maven Everest Challenge

📊 Project Overview
This project was created as part of the Maven Everest Challenge — a data storytelling initiative where participants analyze real expedition data from the Himalayas to reveal human effort, triumphs, and tragedies on Mount Everest.

Using Power BI, I built an interactive and insightful dashboard after cleaning and transforming data across multiple datasets (exped.csv, members.csv, peaks.csv). The focus was filtered to Mount Everest (peakid = EVER) to deliver targeted analysis.
